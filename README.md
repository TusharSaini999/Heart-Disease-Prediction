# ❤️🧠 Heart Disease & Brain Tumor Prediction Web-Based Solution

## 🔍 Overview  
The **Heart Disease & Brain Tumor Prediction** web application is an AI/ML-based healthcare solution designed to help users assess their risk of heart disease and detect brain tumors from medical imaging.  

The platform provides secure authentication, personalized user profiles, and history management for past predictions. It integrates two intelligent models:  
- **Random Forest Classifier** for heart disease prediction  
- **Deep Learning-based CNN model** for brain tumor detection with **Explainable AI (XAI)** for transparency  

This system aims to support early diagnosis and improve healthcare decision-making.
